This study guide contains fours sections of notes on topics related to web development. These topics include HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git and provide some basic, fundamental notes that can be looked at as quick refreshers on these topics. It also contains some console interaction through javascript that can be accessed with Chrome devtools. Finally it serves as a simple program to serve as a baseline for future projects and the general steps of their development and deployment.
